# Time complexity report:
# Iterate each companies,
# Iterate each hashed set,
# Determine in every entry in every subset
# This is N^2
#The problem with this solution stems from the following line:
#    if all(company in subset for company in companies):
#A simple hash lookup wouldve sealed the deal. However, finding a subset within every entry is killing runtime.
#The loop could've been resolve to finding the tuple in the set, instead there's an additional loop
#digging through every subset + digging through their entries.
#Alternative approaches:
